Technical Architecture Plan: MyLocalRIA.com
🔧 Development Approach

Platform Foundation
- Backend: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage, Cloud Functions)
- Frontend: Cursor
- AI Assistant: Used in Cursor to scaffold components, validate logic, and accelerate UI building

Methodology
- Use a MVP-first approach: launch with essential features only (as listed under “Launch Critical”)
- Work in weekly sprints, each targeting a self-contained feature
- Leverage Firebase’s built-in tools to reduce dev workload: Auth, Hosting, Firestore rules, etc.

⚠️ Potential Challenges & Solutions
- Data sync from Form ADV: Preload from your database; defer live updates/scraping for now
- Verification uploads (PDFs, etc.): Use Firebase Storage with security rules for admin-only access
- User review abuse / spam: Require login, store metadata, add moderation queue
- Map performance with many pins: Use marker clustering via Google Maps JS API
- Search scalability: Use Algolia later, but start with Firestore composite indexes
- UI polish: Use AI in Curson to generate clean Tailwind layouts quickly
👥 Resource Requirements
- You (Founder/PM): Make feature decisions, test features, approve claims
- Frontend Dev: Build profile pages, search UI, review forms
- Firebase/Backend Dev: Set up Auth, DB rules, claim logic, admin tools
- Designer (Optional): Help with logos, map pins, mobile layouts
- Compliance Advisor (Optional): Validate display of ADV info is okay
🚧 Step-by-Step Development Plan
🏗️ PHASE 1: Infrastructure & Database Setup (Week 1–2)
- Set up Firebase project: Auth, Firestore, Functions, Storage
- Import Form ADV data to Firestore (your cleaned version)
- Define Firestore collections: users, advisers, reviews, claims, messages, admin_logs
- Set up Firestore security rules (start read-open, write-auth-only)
🔍 PHASE 2: Public Directory & Profile Pages (Week 2–4)
- Build public search page (filters: city, AUM, etc.)
- Display results as cards and Google Maps pins
- Build adviser profile page with static data (as defined in spec)
- Add claimed/unclaimed logic + public contact button
✍️ PHASE 3: Reviews & Ratings (Week 4–5)
- Auth: OAuth + phone verification
- Review form with star + aspects + free text + media upload
- Reviewer identity formatting (“Jane R.”), verification upload optional
- Review list display with sorting/filtering
- Admin ability to flag/remove reviews
✅ PHASE 4: Adviser Claiming (Week 6–7)
- Profile: “Claim this adviser” button
- Claim form with: SMS verification, Business documentation upload
- Admin dashboard to view/approve claims
- Claimed adviser can add supplementary text & reply to reviews
💬 PHASE 5: Messaging & Admin Tools (Week 8–9)
- Build “Message this Adviser” form
- Firestore-triggered messaging record (no real-time chat yet)
- Admin: approve claims, moderate reviews, override data
- Logs of admin actions (timestamp, user_id)
🚀 PHASE 6: QA + Launch Prep (Week 10–11)
- Test all edge cases (unclaimed, flagged, bad uploads, spam)
- Load test map and search
- Finalize UI polish (logos, layout, responsiveness)
- Configure SEO, Google Analytics, sitemap
🧠 Strategy Recommendations
- Use Cursor + AI for UI builds
- Avoid real-time or advanced features at launch
- Moderate claims yourself to build early relationships
- Tag Firebase Functions early for scaling
- Defer mobile app development
✅ Launch Target Metrics
- 50 adviser claims within 60 days
- 100 reviews in first 90 days
- 10% return visitor rate
- <5% flagged review rate
